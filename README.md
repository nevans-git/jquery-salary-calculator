# Jquery Salary Calculator

# Topics involved:
- JavaScript
- jQuery - Selectors, append, and event handling
--------------------------------------------------

## Description:
- The application should have an input form that collects employee first name, last name, ID number, job title, annual salary.

- A 'Submit' button should collect the form information, store the information to calculate monthly costs, append information to the DOM and clear the input fields. Using the stored information, calculate monthly costs and append this to the to DOM. If the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, add a red background color to the total monthly cost.

- Create a delete button that removes an employee from the DOM. For Base mode, it does not need to remove that Employee's salary from the reported total.

 # What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?
 - I was faced with a problem of having to make a salary calculator that needs a place where the user can put employee information such as, employee's first name, last name, ID number, job title and annual salary. Also, I needed to include a submit button that should collect the employee information, store the employee information to use for calculating the monthly costs and append it to the DOM.
    - After doing so, I made a delete button that removed an employee from the table.
